    "# \"Digital Gold\": A Visual Analysis of Bitcoin as a Hedge Against Inflation and Market Volatility\n",
    "\n",
    "As inflation creates general unease within our economy, we're seeing a rise in investments into alternative commodities and assets that are said to \"hedge\"—an investment that's expected to hold or increase its value over time, even as the cost of everything else goes up. One of these assets is Bitcoin ($BTC), a cryptocurrency often dubbed \"Digital Gold\" based on popular sentiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "As governments printed significant amounts of money, especially in recent years, many investors have looked for assets that can protect their wealth from the resulting inflation. Proponents claim Bitcoin, with its fixed supply, is a perfect candidate. A good hedge should ideally be stable, but what if Bitcoin becomes more chaotic and unpredictable precisely when you need it to be a safe haven? This project explores and investigates this popular claim by asking the question:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Does Bitcoin's volatility change during periods of high vs. low inflation?**\n",
    "- **During major stock market crashes, does Bitcoin act as a 'safe haven' by holding its value, or does it crash even harder?**\n",
    "- **How does Bitcoin’s performance change during spikes in market-wide fear and uncertainty, and does it behave more like gold (a hedge) or the S&P 500 (a risk asset)?**\n",
    "- **Does Bitcoin behave like a hedge or a risk asset when U.S. interest rates (DFF) rise or fall, and how does its response compare to gold and the S&P 500?**"

    "## Mining Metrics: Sourcing Our Datasets\n",
    "Several key financial and economic datasets are needed to investigate the relationship between Bitcoin, inflation, and broader market behavior. The following data was sourced from Yahoo Finance (via the `yfinance` library) and the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Bitcoin (BTC-USD)**\n",
    "> This dataset contains the daily price history of Bitcoin valued in U.S. Dollars, which is central to evaluating its performance as an asset.\n",

    "\n",
    "**2. S&P 500 Index (^GSPC)**\n",
    "> This data tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly-traded companies in the United States, offering a snapshot of the overall health of the U.S. stock market. This is essential for analyzing how Bitcoin behaves during broad market movements and crashes.\n",

    "\n",
    "**3. CBOE Volatility Index (^VIX)**\n",

    "\n",
    "**6. Effective Federal Funds Rate (DFF)**\n",
    "> This dataset shows the main interest rate set by the U.S. Federal Reserve. It’s the rate that strongly influences how expensive or cheap it is to borrow money in the economy. When this rate changes, it often affects things like mortgages, credit cards, and the stock market.\n",

    "- **pandas_ta**: A library of technical analysis indicators. While not heavily used here, it’s useful for calculating moving averages, volatility, or other trading metrics if needed.  \n",
    "- **numpy**: Provides fast numerical operations, which support calculations like cumulative returns, percentage changes, and other array-based computations.  \n",
    "- **datetime**: Used to handle and manipulate dates. This is essential for aligning datasets on a common timeline, resampling data into weekly or monthly periods, and clearly defining event windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep our analysis consistent across all datasets, we first resample the raw CPI data to a clean monthly frequency (`MS`). From this standardized monthly series, we are then able to calculate the year-over-year (YoY) inflation rate. This transformation allows us to directly compare inflation trends with the financial assets (Bitcoin, S&P 500, and Gold) on the same timeline, ensuring that our results reflect meaningful economic shifts."

This analysis directly investigates this claim by visually comparing Bitcoin's performance against the S&P 500 during periods of significant market stress. We begin with a long-term view of their cumulative returns to establish context, before zooming in on two critical case studies: the acute, rapid panic of the March 2020 COVID-19 crash and the sustained pressure of the 2022 bear market."

    "A central question for Bitcoin’s role as “Digital Gold” is whether it behaves more like a safe haven (such as gold) or a risk asset (like the S&P 500) when markets are under stress. To test this, we turn to the VIX, often called the “fear index.” The VIX measures expected market volatility by tracking option prices (contracts that let investors bet on or protect against future price moves) on the S&P 500, making it one of the most widely used gauges of investor anxiety and uncertainty.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we focus on periods when the VIX is elevated—moments of heightened fear—and compare the performance of Bitcoin, gold, and the S&P 500. To visualize this, we construct cumulative return indices (growth of \\$1) and overlay shaded regions during high-VIX episodes. This approach makes it clear whether Bitcoin aligns more closely with traditional hedges (like gold) or with risk assets (like equities) in times of fear.  "

    "## Storytelling: Bitcoin as a Hedge Against Inflation and Market Volatility  \n",
    "\n",
    "My project set out to test whether Bitcoin really deserves the title of “Digital Gold,” or if it behaves more like a risky asset that moves with the stock market. To explore this, I built a series of visualizations that compared Bitcoin’s performance with gold (a traditional hedge) and the S&P 500 (a proxy for market risk) across different types of economic stress.  \n",
    "\n",
    "First, I looked at inflation. The results showed that Bitcoin’s volatility rises during high-inflation periods rather than calming down, which means it does not provide the kind of stability expected from a hedge. Gold, in contrast, held steadier during these same periods.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I turned to major stock market crashes. During the COVID-19 crash of early 2020, Bitcoin dropped even harder than the S&P 500 before rebounding more strongly. In the longer 2022 bear market, however, Bitcoin fell sharply and stayed depressed while stocks and gold held up better. These patterns suggest Bitcoin does not protect investors from crashes—it amplifies the risk.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I then examined Bitcoin’s behavior during spikes in market-wide fear, measured with the VIX. By shading high-VIX episodes on a log-scale chart, it became clear that Bitcoin tended to fall in line with equities during these fear events, not act as a safe haven like gold.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I studied interest rate regimes using the Federal Funds Rate. A bar chart of average weekly returns showed Bitcoin thriving in low-rate environments but struggling when rates were high. Gold, by contrast, remained steadier across both regimes, while the S&P 500 barely changed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, these results tell a consistent story: Bitcoin behaves much more like a **risk asset** than a hedge. Its fortunes rise when liquidity is abundant and risk appetite is strong, but it struggles under inflation, monetary tightening, or market fear. Gold continues to serve as the safer hedge, while Bitcoin acts more like a speculative asset whose performance is tied to broader cycles of risk and liquidity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the evidence suggests Bitcoin is not “Digital Gold”—at least not in the way that traditional hedges protect investors during uncertainty. Instead, it is better understood as a high-risk, high-reward asset that amplifies both the upside and the downside of financial markets.  "

    "## Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings of this project carry both useful insights and potential risks. By showing that Bitcoin behaves more like a risk asset than a hedge, the visualizations help clarify misconceptions around the idea of Bitcoin as “Digital Gold.” This could benefit investors and policymakers by setting more realistic expectations about its role in a portfolio.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, these visualizations could cause harm if misinterpreted as financial advice. For example, some might use the charts to justify avoiding Bitcoin entirely, while others might interpret its volatility as an opportunity for speculation without fully understanding the risks. Another limitation is that this analysis relies on historical data up to a certain point in time. Bitcoin and financial markets evolve quickly, and relationships observed in the past may not hold in the future.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, important perspectives are missing. This project focused on U.S. data (inflation, interest rates, VIX, S&P 500), but Bitcoin is a global asset influenced by international demand, regulation, and adoption trends that are not captured here. The datasets also emphasize price and volatility, but not other potential roles Bitcoin might play, such as in cross-border payments or as a store of value in countries with weak currencies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, while the project helps answer key questions about Bitcoin’s behavior under economic stress, it should be read as a piece of evidence within a larger, ongoing conversation rather than a definitive conclusion about Bitcoin’s long-term future.  "
