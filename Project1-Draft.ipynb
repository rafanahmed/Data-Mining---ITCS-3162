    "# \"Digital Gold\": A Visual Analysis of Bitcoin as a Hedge Against Inflation and Market Volatility\n",
    "\n",
    "As inflation creates general unease within our economy, we're seeing a rise in investments into alternative commodities and assets that are said to \"hedge\"—an investment that's expected to hold or increase its value over time, even as the cost of everything else goes up. One of these assets is Bitcoin ($BTC), a cryptocurrency often dubbed \"Digital Gold\" based on popular sentiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "As governments printed significant amounts of money, especially in recent years, many investors have looked for assets that can protect their wealth from the resulting inflation. Proponents claim Bitcoin, with its fixed supply, is a perfect candidate. This project explores and investigates this popular claim, asking:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Does Bitcoin's volatility change during periods of high vs. low inflation? A good hedge should ideally be stable, but what if Bitcoin becomes more chaotic and unpredictable precisely when you need it to be a safe haven?**\n",
    "- **During major stock market crashes, does Bitcoin act as a 'safe haven' by holding its value, or does it crash even harder?**\n",
    "- **Does the relationship between Bitcoin and inflation stay the same over time, or does it change depending on the market environment?**"

    "## Mining Metrics: Sourcing Our Datasets\n",
    "Several key financial and economic datasets are needed to investigate the relationship between Bitcoin, inflation, and broader market behavior. The following data was sourced from Yahoo Finance (via the `yfinance` library) and the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Bitcoin (BTC-USD)**\n",
    "> This dataset contains the daily price history of Bitcoin valued in U.S. Dollars, which is central to evaluating its performance as an asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Source:** Yahoo Finance (`yfinance` Ticker: BTC-USD)\n",
    "- **Link:** https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/\n",
    "- **Features**:\n",
    "    - **Date:** The trading day\n",
    "    - **Open/High/Low/Close:** The opening, highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day.\n",
    "    - **Volume:** The total number of Bitcoins traded.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. S&P 500 Index (^GSPC)**\n",
    "> This data tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly-traded companies in the United States, offering a snapshot of the overall health of the U.S. stock market. This is essential for analyzing how Bitcoin behaves during broad market movements and crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Source:** Yahoo Finance (`yfinance` Ticker: ^GSPC)\n",
    "- **Link:** https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GSPC/\n",

    "\n",
    "**3. CBOE Volatility Index (^VIX)**\n",
    "> Also known as a \"fear index,\" the VIX measures expected market volatility. It is crucial for understanding how Bitcoin's own volatility and price action correlate with periods of market fear and uncertainty.\n",

    " - **Source:** Yahoo Finance (`yfinance` Ticker: ^VIX)\n",
    " - **Link:** https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/^VIX/\n",

    "\n",
    "**4. Gold Futures (GC=F)**\n",

    " - **Link:** https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GC=F/\n",

    "\n",
    "**6. Effective Federal Funds Rate (DFF)**\n",
    "> This dataset tracks the interest rate at which commercial banks lend reserves to each other overnight. It reflects the U.S. monetary policy stance, providing essential context on the macroeconomic environment influencing asset prices.\n",
